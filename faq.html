						<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">Q: What is CM Paid?</a>
						<div class="cd-faq-content">
							<p>CM Paid is an inmate-based commerce payment solution platform. It is
							designed to serve the sole purpose of providing inmate service provider
							companies such as those that sell magazines, books, gifts, clothes, food
							and pictures, with the ability to conduct business with inmates in just
							minutes (CM Paid calls these businesses that use our service "Vendors.").
							Inmates using our phone-based automated purchasing system,
							purchase items or gifts for themselves or someone on the outside, then
							their orders are directly tied into a user dashboard/order alert system
							connected to the inmate service providing business on the other end. This
							permits the business to have the entire order made available to them
							immediately, and the funds for the purchase deposited into their business
							bank account within 24 to 48 hours for faster processing of orders.</p>
						</div> <!-- cd-faq-content -->
					</li>

					<li>
						<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">Q: How much does CM Paid cost Vendors?</a>
						<div class="cd-faq-content">
							<p> All vendors that sign-up now, will receive a FREE 60-day trial once our
							platform goes live in 2018. After that, vendors can continue to use of our
							FREE package plan (which will always be FREE to use) if only planning on
							processing 5 or less orders each month. Our larger plans will come with
							more features and are priced between $19.99 to $99.99 per month based
							on the amount of transactions that are processed for your business each month.</p>
						</div> <!-- cd-faq-content -->
					</li>

					<li>
						<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">Q: How will the CM Paid system know what items my business offers and what the prices and taxes for those items are?</a>
						<div class="cd-faq-content">
							<p>When your Vendor account is approved, you will have access to your CMPaid
							Vendor dashboard. Within that dashboard you will be able to upload
							items by name and item number, and include pricing and any applicable
							taxes. You can upload the items either individually or all at once by using
							a CSV file. Once your items are uploaded to your vendor dashboard,
							anytime that an inmate calls into our automated ordering system, all they
							have to do is state your vendor number, select the item(s) they want,
							select the shipping address, confirm the order, and their done. </p>
						</div> <!-- cd-faq-content -->
					</li>

					<li>
						<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">Q: How does my company receive inmate orders and payment?</a>
						<div class="cd-faq-content">
							<p>Orders are received within your vendor dashboard. Payment is deposited
							directly to your company bank account.</p>
						</div> <!-- cd-faq-content -->
					</li>
					<li>
						<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">Q: What if I need a refund?</a>
						<div class="cd-faq-content">
							<p>All refunds are issued by you to the inmate directly by check or money order.
							CM Paid does not take part in the refund process.</p>
						</div> <!-- cd-faq-content -->
					</li>

					<li>
						<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">Q: Does the vendor dashboard allow me to keep track of my orders? </a>
						<div class="cd-faq-content">
							<p> Yes. You can also printout your transaction history for tax or other purposes if need be.</p>
						</div> <!-- cd-faq-content -->
					</li>

					<li>
						<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">Q: Does my company pay any transaction fees?</a>
						<div class="cd-faq-content">
							<p>Yes. Transaction fees are 2.9% + .30¢ per transaction.
							So if you had an order for $100, you would pay $2.90 + .30¢ (a total of $3.20)
							for the transaction. This transaction fee applies to all of our vendor package plans.</p>
